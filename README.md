# ApplicationStartupPerformanceDemo

A code repository for hosting demo code to optimize the startup performance of an app.

What's in here?
-----------------

In the master branch you can find:
* A suboptimal app build with SAPUI5
* If you throttle your browser or deploy it to a server with high latency, you will feel how slow it is
* You can apply the mechanismns shown in the blog below to boost the startup performance of the app and make it much faster
 
In the Result branch you can find:
* The optimized code of the app with all important steps from the blog posts applied
* It will be about 10x faster than the original code in the master branch for high-latency scenarios

Important: Set your browser language to en_US to avoid additional requests to i18n.properties files. No 404 response codes should appear in network trace.
